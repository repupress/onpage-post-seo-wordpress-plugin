<strong>Welcome to the On-Page and Post SEO Plugin by RepUPress.com</strong>

The On-Page and Post SEO Wordpress Plugin gives your the DIY SEO Tools that will enable you to write better content and analyse it for SEO factors to rank higher in Google, Yahoo and Bing and drive more traffic to your website.

<strong>We have created this Plugin to help you in optimizing your Posts and Pages with 3 powerful tools.  All 3 of these tools are located on the Edit Screen of any Page or Post.</strong>

<strong>On-Page SEO Tool and Checker</strong>

The first of these tools that we would like to showcase is the On-Page SEO Checker.  This tool goes further than other popular SEO Plugins in analysing your post for key SEO metrics and factors the major search engines like Google look for.

<strong>Examples Include</strong>

-  Optimize for Up To 3 Keywords
-  Recieve an Optimization Score as a %
-  See Your Keyword Density
-  H1, H2 and H3 Tags
-  Bold, Italics and Underline Text Suggestions
-  Image Alt Tags
-  Internal Links
-  Text Length

... and much more

<strong>Keyword Suggestion Tool</strong>

The second tool available is the Keyword Suggestion Tool.  This tool enables you to find Semantically Related Keywords.  Google's algorithm is now able, through machine learning, to de-cypher users intent behind searches.  For this reason good page and post search engine optimization should no longer be done for the exact-match strings of keyword phrases.  Instead, we should now be optimizing for "entities" and "concepts".

The keyword suggestion tool allows you to do exactly that by giving you semantically related phrases.  By optimizing your pages and posts with related phrases and concepts you will see you rankings dramatically improve over simply optimizing for exact match keyword phrases.

Another really cool feature of this tool is the ability to quickly add these semantically related phrases as post tags.

You can also quickly generate a list of the suggested keywords which can then quickly and easily be copied and pasted into a tool like Google Adwords Keyword Planner</a> to ascertain statistics like monthly search volume.

<strong>Title Suggestion Tool</strong>

The third tool in this power packed Plugin is the Title Suggestion Tool.  This tool will give you suggestions for subjects to write about that have a high percentage of ranking well in search.  Like the Keyword Suggestion Tool, the technology is based on semantic search and machine language concepts.
